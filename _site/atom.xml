   <title>ErgoDox 76 "Hot Dox" Review</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since starting as a full-time software developer I’ve found myself looking for a
bit more flexibility in a keyboard than I could get from my beloved
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Keyboard-Keycaps-Cherry-Mx-Clear/dp/B00OFM6F80&quot;&gt;Vortex Pok3r&lt;/a&gt;.
I found myself getting stuck in bad typing habits with the traditional staggered
layout and I wasn’t able to configure macros on the base layer for everything
that I wanted. It looked like the best route to get the configurability I wanted
was to build a keyboard myself in some capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I originally had my heart set on building a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard&quot;&gt;Dactyl Manuform&lt;/a&gt; keyboard to jump
fully into the deep end of building a mechanical keyboard. I still think that may
come back as a future project, but until I get consistent access to a 3D printer
(sidebar: Look at your local library’s offerings for 3D printing and other hobby
fabrication, my local library has a great little fabrication lab but unfortunately
a very long waiting list for the certification classes as a result), printing and
hand-wiring a keyboard isn’t going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through a mix of fate and an order mix-up I ended up with a fantastic option for
my use-case - the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alpacakeyboards.com/&quot;&gt;Alpaca Keyboards ErgoDox 76 “Hot Dox”&lt;/a&gt;.
This keyboard keeps the same split, ergonomic layout that I liked about the Dactyl
while making the assembly process significantly easier by using a PCB with hot-swap
connectors. The major game changer in my use of the keyboard has undoubtedly been
the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.qmk.fm/#/&quot;&gt;QMK Firmware&lt;/a&gt; that runs on the Hot Dox’s processor;
being able to remap any key on the keyboard and create all sorts of macros was
essential for transitioning between a traditional keyboard and the split, ortholinear
Hot Dox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;assembly&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m a big fan of side-projects and I’ve run a &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;
site as my personal site for a while now, so it seemed inevitable that I would take
advantage of its blogging capabilities at some point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a number of fun new projects in the works now, hopefully I’ll be able
to put together some nice articles on those in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
