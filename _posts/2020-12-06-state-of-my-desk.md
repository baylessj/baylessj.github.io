title: State of My Desk 2020
---

The set of hardware on my desk has changed pretty dramatically this year. I'll attribute a decent part of that change to COVID-19 and working from home for most of this year; I've had to care a lot more about my working space as a result. I'm putting together this post as a way of reviewing the hardware I'm using and to capture this point in history of my working space, as I anticipate that it will continue to change in the coming year.

## The Basics

Users of Reddit's [r/battlestations]() will likely recognize my desk. I assembled it at the beinning of the year from a handful of IKEA parts. It's large enough to fit everything that I'd like without being completely gigantic.

You can find a build guide for it [here]().

The chair is a Steelcase Criterion I picked up from a local used office supplies store. I would highly recommend getting a used office chair, the Criterion retails for something like $800 and I got it for just $100. I also bought it right at the start of the quarantine and the shop owner was kind enough to arrange for me to pick up the chair outside the shop when it was closed.

## The Desktop

I built a desktop this past year after a long series of issues with the laptops I used in college. 

## Peripherals

Monitors

Keyboard and trackball

Coffee Mug warmer
