title: 'Alpaca Keyboards Hot Dox Review''
---


I recently picked up a [Hot Dox](https://www.alpacakeyboards.com/) keyboard from [Alpaca Keyboards](https://www.alpacakeyboards.com/) as my introduction to the world of split ergonomic keyboards. My primary goals in moving from a traditional mechanical keyboard were to get an improvement in ergonomics and to get much more customization potential than I had with my current keyboards. The Hot Dox is acceptable on the ergonomics front and excellent on the customization front due to its use of the [QMK Firmware](https://qmk.fm/).

### Ergonomics

The layout of the Hot Dox differs in many ways from a traditional keyboard and, in my opinion, those differences are largely for the better. The Hot Dox is a clone of the [Ergodox](https://ergodox-ez.com/) keyboard, which is described as an _ortholinear, split ergonomic keyboard_. For those who aren't familiar, I'll break down those adjectives individually.

#### Ortholinear

An _ortholinear_ keyboard is a keyboard where each of the keys are grouped in straight columns rather than in a staggered layout like a traditional keyboard. In my experience it is a surprisingly different experience to type on an ortholinear keyboard compared to a traditional; the keys are only moved a tiny bit on the keyboard but forcing the keys into perfect columns drastically changed the way my fingers moved to hit most keys. Hitting keys that are not on home row is achieved through a linear movement of the corresponding typing finger and there is no need for a change in hand orientation. 

After a couple of months with my Hot Dox I still can't claim to be completely used to this new layout, but it makes a lot more sense than a staggered layout. It seems to me like a milder version of switching to a non-traditional layout like [Dvorak](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard)-- while there are pros to the changed layout, one will likely always have times when the have to switch back to a traditional layout. I have not had too hard of a time making the mental switch associated with using a traditional keyboard some times and the ortholinear layout at other times, but it is definitely still noticeable.

#### Split

A _split_ keyboard is very easily noticeable as such, the halves of the keyboard associated with each typing hand are, well, split apart.
