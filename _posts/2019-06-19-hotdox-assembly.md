Since starting as a full-time software developer I've found myself looking for a
bit more flexibility in a keyboard than I could get from my beloved
[Vortex Pok3r](https://www.amazon.com/Mechanical-Keyboard-Keycaps-Cherry-Mx-Clear/dp/B00OFM6F80).
I found myself getting stuck in bad typing habits with the traditional staggered
layout and I wasn't able to configure macros on the base layer for everything
that I wanted. It looked like the best route to get the configurability I wanted
was to build a keyboard myself in some capacity.

I originally had my heart set on building a
[Dactyl Manuform](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard) keyboard to jump
fully into the deep end of building a mechanical keyboard. I still think that may
come back as a future project, but until I get consistent access to a 3D printer
(sidebar: Look at your local library's offerings for 3D printing and other hobby
fabrication, my local library has a great little fabrication lab but unfortunately
a very long waiting list for the certification classes as a result), printing and
hand-wiring a keyboard isn't going to happen.

Through a mix of fate and an order mix-up I ended up with a fantastic option for
my use-case - the [Alpaca Keyboards ErgoDox 76 "Hot Dox"](https://www.alpacakeyboards.com/).
This keyboard keeps the same split, ergonomic layout that I liked about the Dactyl
while making the assembly process significantly easier by using a PCB with hot-swap
connectors. The major game changer in my use of the keyboard has undoubtedly been
the [QMK Firmware](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/) that runs on the Hot Dox's processor;
being able to remap any key on the keyboard and create all sorts of macros was
essential for transitioning between a traditional keyboard and the split, ortholinear
Hot Dox.
