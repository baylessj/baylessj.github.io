Here's another installation in my [ongoing](https://jonathanbayless.com/2020/0807/zettelkasten-foam.html) [series](https://jonathanbayless.com/2020/03/09/zettelkasten-vimwiki.html) of zettelkasten
tooling updates. I have changed up my preferred set of tooling again in the time
since the last post, and I'm now using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). I discussed my reasons for
_not_ using Obsidian in that last post, but both Obsidian and my workflow have
changed some since then.

My main complaint in the past post about Obsidian was its autocompletion for
note-to-note links. I'm not sure if there was a software update to fix this while
I was using Foam or what, but the autocompletion seems much better now. I can't
really think of any complaints with the Obsidian editor compared to VS Code with
Foam.

I also have relied quite a bit on Obsidian's [Zootelkeeper](https://github.com/akosbalasko/zoottelkeeper-obsidian-plugin) plugin, which
automatically adds links to newly created links in an index file in the note's
directory. This plugin makes it easy to keep a link between similar notes without
manually adding references to every related note throughout the new note. As a
result, my Zettelkasten keeps a nice looking graph automatically:

{% assign image=page.image[0] %}
{% include srcset-sizes.html %}

Even though I've switched tools a lot before, I'd be surprised if I end up with
another, similar post about switching to a new tool in the future. Obsidian is
fitting great with my workflow, and it seems to have a community dedicated to
continually making it even better.
