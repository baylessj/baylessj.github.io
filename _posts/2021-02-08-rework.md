- Don't turn guesses into plans. Plans let the past drive the future.
- Small is a fine destination. Lots of big companies strive to act like they're small again but it's way harder to shrink a company than it is to grow it.
- If all you do is work your decisions will end up skewed and you won't be able to determine well what is and isn't worth time.
- If no one is upset by your opinions then you aren't pushing hard enough or you're just boring
- Get to a great product by cutting out what is merely good.
- Figure out what the epicenter of the business is -- if I stop selling this thing, will I cease to have a business?
- Don't postpone decisions, you're as likely to make a good decision today as tomorrow -- disagree!
- Long projects zap morale, the longer it takes to develop the less likely it is to launch
- Be a curator -- pare things down to only what is essential
- Break big projects into little projects and then go one step at a time
- Don't care about beating the big player in your industry, do your own thing
- If you are a consumer business, it's alright if customers outgrow your product
- Only implement the requests you hear over and over from customers
- Advertise by teaching relevant skills to your product, write a "cookbook" equivalent for your teaching
- Hiring a lot of people quickly will make it so that no one challenges ideas and instead just appeases
