title: GBoards Gergoplex Keyboard Review
tags: keyboard
---

I recently came across the GBoards line of low-profile keyboards and immediately wanted to try out this thinner design. I still stand by my previous positive review of the [Alpaca Keyboards HotDox]() that I was using as my daily driver, but the GBoards designs addressed a couple of my pain points with it:

- The height of the HotDox, and most normal keyboards, for that matter, all but required wrist rests. The addition of wrist rests was an improvement in ergonomics but annoying to keep in place on my desk and keep clean.
- The lighter switch springs in the GBoards choc switches weren't what attracted me to the keyboards in the first place, but the 20g springs are magnificent. I put silent red switches in my HotDox, which are pretty light switches, but the 20g choc switches make the Cherry switches feel like molasses.
