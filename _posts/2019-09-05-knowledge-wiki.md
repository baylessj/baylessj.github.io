It's pretty clear from looking at the lack of posts on my blog thus far that I haven't entirely taken to my blogging idea. I have a lot of half-finished posts sitting in separate git branches currently, but getting the resolve to complete them has been a struggle. I'm finding that the current status of my blog writing attempt offers some useful insights into my process of learning new tech.

Upon further reading of other software developers' blogs and comparing them to my own post ideas I've realized that there is a fundamental misalignment between my current mantra of learning a mishmash of software tooling and the narrow focus of many software blogs.
