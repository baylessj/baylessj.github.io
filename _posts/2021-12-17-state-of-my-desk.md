Last year I put together [a blog post](https://jonathanbayless.com/2020/1206/state-of-my-desk.html) describing the technology I keep on my desk. I've changed some things around since then, so here is this year's post.

Most of the basics on my desk have stayed the same over the past year. I still have the same two monitors in the same configuration and the same desktop. Then again, there's a bit of a Theseus' ship deal going on with the desktop, as I had to replace the motherboard, the power supply, and the GPU after all three somehow failed at the same time. The speakers are the same, but up in a new home to make room on my desk. I'm also using the same Logitech MX Ergo trackball mouse. I'm planning to make a change to the mouse as soon as my new switches for it come in though, since the stock mouse button switches have been failing and making it so that clicking and dragging the mouse doesn't always work.

You may notice two keyboards sitting on my desk here, neither of which were in the photo from last year. My primary keyboard is the GBoards Gergoplex, which I wrote [a review about](https://jonathanbayless.com/2020/1007/gergoplex-review.html) a bit before the blog post about my desk last year. Unfortunately that blog post took place in the time between that keyboard getting shorted out by a tipped over glass of water and the keyboard getting replaced. The second keyboard is a Pok3r that I've had for a while. I prefer the Gergoplex for the majority of tasks, but the layers I have set up in QMK make it hard to use WASD for movement in games. The simplicity of the Pok3r makes it a better choice for games as a result.
